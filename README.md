# Time Series Anomaly Detection with LSTM Autoencoders


The following steps will be followed to detect anomalies in Johnson & Johnson stock price data using an LSTM autoencoder :

*  Train an LSTM autoencoder on the Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s stock price data from 1980 to 2021. The assumption was made that there were no anomalies in the training dataset.

*  Using the LSTM autoencoder to reconstruct the error on the test data.

*  If the reconstruction error for the test data is above the threshold, labeled the data point as an anomaly.
